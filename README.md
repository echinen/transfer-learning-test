Transfer learning / fine-tuning
This tutorial will guide you through the process of using transfer learning to learn an accurate image classifier from a relatively small number of training samples. Generally speaking, transfer learning refers to the process of leveraging the knowledge learned in one model for the training of another model.

More specifically, the process involves taking an existing neural network which was previously trained to good performance on a larger dataset, and using it as the basis for a new model which leverages that previous network's accuracy for a new task. This method has become popular in recent years to improve the performance of a neural net trained on a small dataset; the intuition is that the new dataset may be too small to train to good performance by itself, but we know that most neural nets trained to learn image features often learn similar features anyway, especially at early layers where they are more generic (edge detectors, blobs, and so on).

Transfer learning has been largely enabled by the open-sourcing of state-of-the-art models; for the top performing models in image classification tasks (like from ILSVRC), it is common practice now to not only publish the architecture, but to release the trained weights of the model as well. This lets amateurs use these top image classifiers to boost the performance of their own task-specific models.
